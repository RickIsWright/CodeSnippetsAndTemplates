# CodeSnippetsAndTemplates
This repository includes mainly custom shortcut code snippets and some templates for the Telerik and Kendo UI controls/widgets.

To check all Telerik AJAX controls that have custom shortcuts available, check [Create Sample markup snippets for all Telerik controls](https://github.com/telerik/CodeSnippetsAndTemplates/issues/3) issue.

## What are the "snippets" and how to use them

They are shortcuts that you can write in your editor, press Tab and some code will be automatically generated.
